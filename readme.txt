The <a href="http://dupeoff.com">DupeOff</a> plagiarism and duplicate content detection plugin allows you to check posts for duplicate content via the DupeOff API.

== Description ==
**Why DupeOff?**
<p>
With the Google Panda update it is ever more important to have unique and compelling content. Don't let content thieves ruin your search engine rankings and traffic, detect plagiarism early.
The DupeOff plugin adds a link on the admin listings of posts allowing you to generate a report of duplicate content. Check the screenshots for an example! 
While you can easily check duplicate content manually by pasting a sentence into a search engine, this quickly becomes boring when you have to check a lot of text. Also, content thieves often take just parts of your and others text, such as a paragraph in the middle, quickly assembling spam articles that robs you of your search rankings.

**Make Money**
<p>

Optionally, you can participate in the DupeOff affiliate program through Clickbank if you are interested in promoting the tool, and earning a side income. By placing the DupeOff button under your posts you not only inform your visitor that you take copyright seriously, but if a visitor clicks through to dupeoff.com and purchases a package you earn 50% of every sale.
